# SustainaLens — Company Sustainability Calculator

A lightweight Python tool to evaluate companies' climate strategies and performance.  
It transforms raw sustainability disclosures (Scopes 1–3, revenue, employees, targets, renewables, CDP score, etc.) into actionable metrics:

- Carbon intensity (per revenue & employee)  
- Year-on-year emissions change  
- Four pillar scores:
  - Ambition (targets, interim cuts, SBTi validation)
  - Progress (actual reductions, renewables, green capex)
  - Disclosure (CDP rating, data completeness)
  - Credibility (do actions back up claims?)
- Composite Net-Zero Readiness score (0–1 scale)  
- Greenwash risk flag (Low / Medium / High)
